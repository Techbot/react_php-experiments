# react_php-experiments
my investigation into reactPhp

This is mostly  stuff By Cees-Jan @ http://blog.wyrihaximus.net/categories/reactphp-series/

Then there's mysql by Jin Hu @ https://github.com/bixuehujin/reactphp-mysql

My aim is to build a heartbeat for an ONLINE RPG. The loop will examine all NPCs in a MYSQL database that are angry 
and have the NPC attack a player within range.

I'm sure I'll come up with more ideas.
